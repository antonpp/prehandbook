## The Road To Prompt Reliability Engineering
- This article introduces Prompt Reliability Engineering (PRE) for LLM applications.
- It outlines the progression of prompt operations maturity, including logging, tracing, and feedback.
- Evaluations are crucial, serving as the "source code" and "moat" for LLM applications.
- Key Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for PRE encompass quality, performance, and cost.
- An error budget helps prioritize between reliability enhancements and development velocity.
