## Road To Prompt Reliability Engineering
### Introduction
This article introduces the concept of Prompt Reliability Engineering as the final step on the prompt-ops maturity ladder. We will walk up this ladder and talk through the concepts and best practices on each of the steps. If you just deployed your first genai app and you're starting to get overwhelmed scrolling through the application logs or if prompt engineering  seems like taking one step forward and two steps back then this article is for you.

### Prompt-ops maturity levels
#### Yoloing prompts
This is where every project starts and many end. If you update a piece of text in VScode, hit save ,and then go on to refresh a web-page to try the changes in a chat app, then you're likely in this stage. You're hopefully using github or some type of source code versioning to save the changes to your prompts. Bonus points if you've set-up some type of ci/cd workflow that also deploys changes commited to your production app.
